# Quarterly ISA Rebalancing System: Multi-Agent Architecture
## Executive Summary
This document describes a multi-agent system for quarterly analysis and rebalancing recommendations for a long-term, low-risk Vanguard Stocks and Shares ISA. The system is designed around Advanced Context Engineering principles: frequent intentional compaction, sub-agent isolation, artifact-first workflows, and strategic human leverage points.
The system runs quarterly, producing:

- Accumulated research artifacts that build institutional knowledge over time
- Structured macro trend reports (interest rates, currencies, commodities)
- Portfolio movement analysis
- Risk-aware rebalancing recommendations

Human involvement is limited to final review of recommendations—the system operates autonomously through research and synthesis phases.
